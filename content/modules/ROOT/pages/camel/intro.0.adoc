The architecture diagram below illustrates all the technologies at play providing a pluggable and scalable platform.

The diagram above is divided in 2 blocks:

- A shared namespace providing pre-built and pre-deployed elements.
- A user namespace (your workspace in OpenShift), where you will work to complete all the Camel integrations (3 as described previously).

The diagram also shows how the architecture was conceived to easily plugin new systems (represented with the question mark *?*). One such example (fictional) is the SpringBoot application (green hexagon in the diagram). You will indeed work to integrate the Globex portal to the platform.
