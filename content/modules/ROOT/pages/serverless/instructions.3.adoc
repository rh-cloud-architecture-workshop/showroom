== Create Knative triggers
You will now create triggers which will invoke the HTTP endpoint of Knative services depending on the CloudEvents headers. +
Each CloudEvents created will be tagged with specific values in the headers `ce-type` and `ce-source` which is then used by the Trigger to route them to the correct service HTTP endpoint

* Click on the *(+)* icon found on top of the OpenShift Console to access the *Import YAML* wizard.
* Copy and paste the following CRD to create the 3 Triggers matching the 3 Knative services

* Click on the Broker `globex-broker` to view how the three Knative services subscribe to the KnativeBroker using the Triggers; also note the various filters applied to the triggers. +
These filters are the ones which help to match the CloudEvents header of each  message to the right service which will act on the message.
