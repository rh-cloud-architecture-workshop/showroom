== Deployment Overview

The architecture of the Cashback service looks as follows:

image::cdc/globex-deployment-3.png[]

Most of the components have been deployed for you as part of the provisioning of the lab. What is missing is the Debezium connector to power Change Data Capture, and the Camel K integration services to populate the cashback service with customer and order data.

== Deploy the Debezium Connector

Let's start with deploying the Debezium Connector. With AMQ Streams, a Kafka Connect connector can be deployed as a Kubernetes Custom Resource, which is picked up and processed by the AMQ Streams operator.

To deploy the connector, you are going to use OpenShift Dev Spaces. OpenShift Dev Spaces uses Kubernetes and containers to provide a consistent, secure, and zero-configuration development environment, accessible from a browser window.

* In a browser window, navigate to the browser tab pointing to the Developer perspective of the OpenShift cluster. If you don't have a browser tab open on the console, open a new tab and navigate to {openshift_cluster_console}. If needed login with your username and password ({user_name}/{user_password}).

* On the top menu of the console, click on the image:openshift-application-menu.png[] icon, and in the drop-down box, select *Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces*.
+
image::openshift-application-menu-2.png[]

* Login in with your OpenShift credentials ({user_name}/{user_password}). If this is the first time you access Dev Spaces, you have to authorize Dev Spaces to access your account. In the _Authorize Access_ window click on *Allow selected permissions*.

* You are directed to the Dev Spaces overview page, which shows the workspaces you have access to. You should see a single workspace, called *cloud-architecture-workshop*. The workspace needs a couple of seconds to start up.
+
image::devspaces-workspace-starting.png[]

* Click on the *Open* link of the workspace.
+
image::devspaces-workspace-started-1.png[]

* This opens the workspace, which will look pretty familiar if you are used to work with VS Code. Before opening the workspace, a pop-up might appear asking if you trust the contents of the workspace. Click *Yes, I trust the authors* to continue.
+
image::devspaces-trust-contents.png[]

* The workspace contains all the resources you are going to use during the workshop, including the Debezium connector. In the project explorer on the left of the workspace, navigate to the *workshop/module-cdc* folder and open the *debezium-connector.yaml* file.
+
image::cdc/devspaces-workspace-debezium-connector.png[]

* The *debezium-connector.yaml* file describes the Debezium Connector. It contains all the details the connector needs to know in order to start capturing changes in the target database tables. Some important configuration details:
** *class*: the Debezium connector implementation class. We're using PostgreSQL as source database, so the approriate connector is *io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector*.
** *plugin.name*: The Debezium connector supports different mechanisms to read from the PostgreSQL transaction logs.  *pgoutput* is the standard logical decoding output plug-in since PostgreSQL 10.
** *+database.*+*: the connection details for the database. Note that PostgreSQL is setup with a specific user (*debezium*) which has the required privileges to read from the transaction logs.
** *topic.prefix*: the prefix of the Kafka topics which will receive the Debezium change events. The full name of the topics is *<prefix>.<schema>.<table>*.
** *schema.include.list*: the schema's to include in the change data capture process.
** *table.include.list*: the name of the tables to include. For our use case we are interested in the *customer*, *orders* and *line_item* tables.

* Before deploying the connector, you need to substitute the placeholder for the database hostname with the actual value. On line 14, replace
+
----
<REPLACE WITH DATABASE HOSTNAME>
----
+
with
+
[source,textinfo,role=execute]
----
globex-db.globex-{user_name}.svc.cluster.local
----
+
which is the internal DNS name of the Globex retail application database.

* You can deploy the connector to the OpenShift cluster directly from Dev Spaces. To do so, click on the image:devspaces-menu.png[] icon on the top of the left menu, and select *Terminal/New Terminal* from the drop-down menu.
+
image::cdc/devspaces-menu-new-terminal.png[]

* This opens a terminal in the bottom half of the workspace.
+
image::cdc/devspaces-menu-terminal.png[]

* The OpenShift Dev Spaces environment has access to a plethora of command line tools, including *oc*, the OpenShift  command line interface. Through OpenShift Dev Spaces you are automatically logged in into the OpenShift cluster. You can verify this with the command *oc whoami*.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc whoami
----
+
.Output
----
{user_name}
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the the output of the `oc whoami` command does not correspond to your username ({user_name}), you need to logout and login again with the correct username.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc logout
oc login -u {user_name} -p {user_password} {openshift_api_internal}
----
====

* Deploy the Debezium connector by copying the following command to the terminal:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f workshop/module-cdc/debezium-connector.yaml -n globex-cdc-{user_name}
----
+
.Output
----
kafkaconnector.kafka.strimzi.io/globex created
----

* After a few seconds, the Debezium connector will start monitoring the PostgreSQL database for changes in the *customer*, *orders* and *line_item* tables, and will produce a change event to the corresponding Kafka topic for each change detected.

* One way to verify that the connector is working as expected is to check the Kafka topics that receive the change events. 
If you still have a browser tab pointing to Kafdrop, open the tab. If not, open a new browser tab and navigate to {kafdrop_url}. +
At the bottom of the topic list in the Kafdrop overview page, you will see the three topics that will receive the change events.
+
image::cdc/kafdrop-debezium-topics.png[]

* The Globex application database contains records for a couple of hundred customers in the *customer* table, so we can expect a change event for each of these records. In the Kafdrop UI, click on the *globex.updates.public.customer* topic. This opens a view with details on the topic. Notice that the size of the topic is _200_, which corresponds to the number of records in the *customer* table.
+
image::cdc/kafdrop-debezium-topic-customers.png[]

* Click on the link representing the only partition of the topic to see the contents of the partition.
+
image::cdc/kafdrop-debezium-topic-customers-partition.png[]
+
This opens a view to the individual messages in the topic. You can expand every message to inspect its content. In this case, the body of each message consists of a Debezium change event in JSON format.
+
image::cdc/kafdrop-debezium-topic-customers-1.png[]

* A Debezium change event has a well-defined structure. Take particular note of the following elements:
** *before*: the state of the record before the transaction. As the change events correspond to newly read records, there is no previous state. 
** *after*: the state of the record after the transaction. This is a JSON representation of the current state of the record in the database (every column in the table becomes a JSON field).
** *op*: The operation that leads to the change event. Possible values are '*c*' for _create_, '*u*' for _update_, '*d*' for _delete_ and '*r*' for _read_. As the records in the *customer* already existed when the Debezium connector was deployed, the operation is '*r*'.

* The Globex application database does not contain any order information at the moment, so the *globex.updates.public.orders* and *globex.updates.public.line_item* topics are empty. You can verify this through the Kafdrop UI. +
In the next section of the workshop, you will create some orders, and verify that the corresponding change events are picked up by Debezium.  

== Create an Order in the Globex Retail Application

* If you still have a browser tab open pointing to the Globex retail web application, open the tab. If not, open a new tab and navigate to {globex_web_url}.

* In order to place an order, you need to login into the Globex application. Click on the *Login* link on the right of the top menu.
+
image::cdc/globex-login.png[]

* The Globex web application uses OpenId Connect powered by Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO) to authenticate users. After clicking the *Login* link you are redirected to the login page of the SSO server, where you need to enter your credentials. +
The SSO server is set up with a number of users corresponding to customers in the Globex application. Login with one of the following users: *asilva*,*mmiller*,*asanders*,*cjones* or *pwong*. The password for all the users is *{globex_user_password}*.
+
image::cdc/globex-login-sso.png[]

* Once logged in, you can browse through the catalog and add items to the shopping cart. +
+
**__Note:__** When adding an item to the shopping cart, there is no "close" button for that item. You can use the browser "back" button to return to the catalog. The Globex UX team has been notified and is already working on adding a "close" button ;-)

* To check out the cart and place an order, click on the *Cart* link in the top menu.
+
image::cdc/globex-goto-cart.png[]

* This brings you to the cart view. From there you can proceed to checkout by clicking *Proceed to Checkout*.
+
image::cdc/globex-cart-checkout.png[]

* In the checkout page, click the *Autofill form* to populate the form with the details of the logged in user.
+
image::cdc/globex-checkout-1.png[]

* Finally, click *Submit order* to submit your order.
+
image::cdc/globex-checkout-3.png[]

* If the order is submitted successfully, you will be redirected to a success page:
+
image::cdc/globex-order-placed.png[]

* At this point, an order has been added in the Globex application database. The records added to the *orders* and *line_item* tables have been detected by Debezium and produced as change events to Kafka topics. +
We can easily check this with Kafdrop.

* Open the browser tab pointing to the Kafdrop UI. If you did close the tab, open a new tab and navigate to {kafdrop_url}. +
Open the *globex.updates.public.orders* topic, and verify that the topic contains 1 message.
+
image::cdc/kafdrop-debezium-topic-orders.png[]
+
Drill down into the partition and expand the contents of the message. You should see a change event structure very similar to the ones for customers. Notice however that the operation is '*c*', for _create_. This is expected as the change event corresponds to a new record in the *order* table.
+
Go back to the Kafdrop homepage by clicking on the *Kafdrop* link on the top of the page, and this time open the *globex.updates.public.line_item* topic. You should see one message per item in the order you created previously.
+
image::cdc/kafdrop-debezium-topic-orders-2.png[]

* If you want to simulate a larger number of orders, you can use the _Order simulator_ application deployed in the _globex-{user_name}_ namespace on OpenShift.
** In the browser window, open the tab pointing to the OpenShift console. If you don't have a tab open to the console, open a new tab and navigate to {openshift_cluster_console}. If needed login with your username and password ({user_name}/{user_password}).
** Select the *Topology* view in the Developer perspective. If needed, switch to the *globex-{user_name}* namespace by selecting the namespace from the namespace selection drop-down menu in the top left.
+
image::cdc/openshift-console-developer-select-namespace.png[]
** In the Topology view, click on the image:openshift-console-open-url.png[] symbol next to the *order-simulator* deployment.
+
image::cdc/openshift-console-open-url-4.png[]
** This opens a Swagger UI page showing the REST API of the simulator. +
Click on the *POST* link, and then on the *Try it out* link on the right. From the *Examples* drop down, select *random customers* to create orders for random customers. Feel free to change the numbers of orders you want to simulate (the default is 50).
+
image::cdc/order-simulator-random-customer.png[]
** Click *Execute* to execute the REST call to the simulator.
** Check in Kafdrop that new messages are produced to the *globex.updates.public.orders* and *globex.updates.public.line_item* topics.

== Streaming processing of events with Kafka Streams

Debezium produces a stream of data change events in one or more Kafka topics. In some cases the data in these topics need to be transformed, combined or aggregated before they can be consumed by target services.

In our use case for instance, the cashback service is interested in the total value of an order, not necessarily the value of each individual line item. However, The _orders_ table in the Globex retail database does not contain the total value, as you can see in the entity relationship diagram.

image::cdc/globex-db-erd-orders.png[]

So we need to somehow combine the data change events streams from the _orders_ table with the stream of the _line_items_ table to obtain the total value for each order.

This is where stream processing libraries or frameworks come in. Libraries like Kafka Streams or Apache Flink allow to process streams of data consumed from a Kafka cluster in a continuous fashion. The result of the processing is typically stored in topics on the Kafka cluster. Processing capabilities can be stateless or stateful. Stateless processing include data transformations, filtering, mapping and so on. Stateful operations include aggregations and joins.

The processing logic of a Kafka Streams application is defined in a _topology_, which forms a graph of stream processors, where each processor represents a processing step in the processing topology. Kafka Streams comes with a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to define the topology in Java.

If you are familiar with SQL, a topology is quite similar to a set of SQL queries, but then applied on a stream of data rather then on static tables.

The _order-aggregator_ service uses Kafka Streams to calculate the total value of an order out of the data change events of the _orders_ and _line_items_ tables. The topology does the following:

* Consumes from the *globex.updates.public.orders* and *globex.updates.public.line_item* topics.
* Joins the LineItem events with the Order events by Order ID. This produces a new stream of events which contain both the Order and the LineItem.
* Groups the joined stream by Order ID
* Aggregates the joined stream to produce a stream of _AggregatedOrder_ events. The aggregation function adds the value of each individual line item to the total order value.
* Publishes the aggregated order events in a Kafka topic, in this case the *globex.order-aggregated* topic.

== Build and deploy integrations with Camel K

Apache Camel is an open source integration framework that allows you to quickly and easily integrate various systems consuming or producing data. It is based on the well known Enterprise Integration patterns and allows you to define routing and mediation rules in a variety of domain-specific languages (such as Java, XML, Groovy, Kotlin, and YAML). It does so by providing over 300 components and connectors.

Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes or OpenShift and is specifically designed for microservice and serverless architectures.
When using Camel K you can instantly run integration code written in Camel DSL on Kubernetes or OpenShift, without having to package the code into an application and building a container image. 

In this workshop we leverage Camel and Camel K to bridge between the Kafka topics which contain the customer data change events and the aggregated orders, and the _Cashback_ service.

The first integration we need is pretty simple: we need to consume the aggregated order records from the Kafka *globex.order-aggregated* topic, and call a REST endpoint on the Cashback service. No data transformation is required. A relatively simple integration like this one is ideally suited to be expressed in YAML.

* In a browser window, navigate to the browser tab pointing to the Dev Spaces workspace you opened earlier to inspect and deploy the Debezium connector. If you don't have a browser tab open on the Dev Spaces workspace, refer to the instructions in the <<_deploy_the_debezium_connector>> section.

* The Camel K connector for the aggregated orders is defined in the *workshop/module-cdc/order-connector/cashback-order-connector.yaml* file.
+
image::cdc/devspaces-workspace-order-connector.png[]

* Take note of the following elements:
** *from*: Camel integrations are defined as _routes_,  a set of processing steps that are applied to a message as it travels from a source to a destination. An integration contains 1 or more routes. A route typically starts with a _from_ statement, which defines the source of the route. 
** *from.uri*: the source of the route, typically expressed as a URI. The scheme (*kafka*) defines which connector to use. The *{{ }}* placeholders refer to properties defined in a properties file.
** *steps*: the different steps in the integration. In this simple integration, the body contents of the incoming message is logged, and a couple of headers are set on the message.
** *to*: the destination of the integration. In this case a HTTP endpoint on the _Cashback_ service is called. The headers set previously determine how to handle the HTTP call (POST with JSON payload)
** *traits*: the comment lines at the top of the file provide additional configuration settings for the integration. Here we define a property file (*cashback-order-connector.properties*) which contain the properties for the integration, as well as a secret which contains the connection details for the Kafka broker. 

* The connector YAML file can be deployed as such to the OpenShift cluster using the *kamel* CLI. Under the hood the CLI will transform the YAML file into an *Integration* Custom Resource. When deployed to OpenShift, the Camel K operator processes the Integration Custom Resource and transforms the Integration into a running application.
** Go into the terminal of the Dev Spaces workspace. If you don't have an open terminal, you can open a new one by selecting the image:devspaces-menu.png[] icon on the top of the left menu, and selecting *Terminal/New Terminal* from the drop-down menu.
** In the terminal, issue the following command:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]

----

The second integration we need is slightly more complex: we need to consume the change events from the *customer* table from the Kafka topic, determine whether the change event corresponds to a *create/read* or *update* change, transform the data and finally call a REST endpoint (POST for create, PUT for update) on the _Cashback_ service. +
This time the integration logic is expressed in Groovy, a dynamic language for the Java virtual machine.

* In a browser window, navigate to the browser tab pointing to the Dev Spaces workspace you opened earlier. If you don't have a browser tab open on the Dev Spaces workspace, refer to the instructions in the <<_deploy_the_debezium_connector>> section.

* The Camel K integration for the customer change events is defined in the *workshop/module-cdc/customer-connector/cashback-customer-connector.groovy* file.
+
image::cdc/devspaces-workspace-customer-connector.png[]
+
Reading through the code should give you an idea what the code actually does. +
In a nutshell, messages are consumed from the Kafka topic and marshalled into a JSON object. The payload is introspected using JSONPath to determine the nature of the change event, and set headers on the message accordingly. Finally the payload for the REST call is built and the REST endpoint called.

* The deployment of the integration is very similar to what you did for the order integration.

== End-to-end Scenario

With the Debezium connector and the two Camel K integrations deployed, you have all the pieces of the solution in place:

* Data change events from the Globex web application are captured by Debezium and produced to Kafka topics.
* A Kafka Streams application combines and aggregates the data change event streams for _orders_ and _line_item_ at real time to produce a new stream of aggregated order events.
* Camel K integrations consume from Kafka topics and call REST endpoints on the Cashback service, to build a local view of customers and orders, and calculate the cashback amounts.

The cashback service has a rudimentary UI that allows to verify the generated cashbacks.

* In the browser window, open the tab pointing to the OpenShift console. If you don’t have a tab open to the console, open a new tab and navigate to {openshift_cluster_console}. If needed login with your username and password ({user_name}/{user_password}). Select the *Topology* view in the Developer perspective and make sure you are on the *globex-cdc-{user_name}* namespace.

* In the Topology view, locate the Cashback service deployment, and click on the *Open URL* symbol next to it.
+
image::cdc/openshift-console-topology-cashback-service.png[]

* This opens a browser window with the cashback UI, which shows the list of customers together with their earned cashbacks.
+
image::cdc/cashback-service-ui.png[]

* You should see some customers with a cashback greater than $0. You might need to advance through several pages if you don't see any customers with a cashback value grater than 0$. If you still don't see any, please simulate some orders as detailed earlier in this chapter. +
Click on a cashback with value greater then $0. You should see the list of orders leading to the cashback.
+
image::cdc/cashback-service-ui-2.png[]

* At this point, you can demonstrate the end-to-end flow starting from creating an order in the Globex web application.
** Create an order in the Globex application.
** Verify in Kafdrop that the order and line items are picked up by the Debezium connector.
** Still in Kafdrop, verify that an aggregated order event is created by the Kafka Streams application.
** In the logs of the Camel K order connector, check that the aggregated order is sent to the Cashback service.
** In the Cashback service UI, locate the customer you created the order for, and check that it appears in the Cashback list.  

*Congratulations*

Congratulations! With this you have completed the *Change Data Capture* module! You successfully leveraged Change Data Capture to create change event streams, and consume these streams to power new services and functionality. 

Please close all but the Workshop Deployer browser tab to avoid proliferation of browser tabs which can make working on other modules difficult.
